This is a description file for Comet_67P_CG Perple_X runs.

They was run with Perple_X version 6.8.7.

The composition represents the bulk composition of comet 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko, based on a painstaking synthesis of:
 - Filachione et al. 2019 Space Sci. Rev.
 - Bardyn et al. 2017 MNRAS
 - Le Roy et al. 2015 A & A
 - Pätzold et al. 2016 Nature
 - Dhooghe et al. 2017 MNRAS

The thermodynamic database used was DEW17HP622ver_elements.dat, version 2019-11-18.

Solution models included, and phases excluded, were based on the recommended settings in J.F. Moyen's Excel spreadsheet for the "igneous set" of models from "Holland, TJB, Green, ECR & Powell, R (2018). Melting of peridotites through to granites: a simple thermodynamic model in the system KNCFMASHTOCr. Journal of Petrology 59 881-900". Namely, melt(H) phases were allowed, among others. Organics were allowed because their stoichiometry has been corrected. CaCl2 stoichiometry has also been corrected. Comet_67P_CG_v6 and Comet_67P_CG_v7 are identical, but Comet_67P_CG_v7 has an extended P-T range (perhaps adequate for modeling Triton).

Note that fluids and melt are allowed and that WERAMI tables show bulk (aggregate) properties of fluids and solids ("fluid_properties_included"), unless specified ("fluid_properties_not_included"). Be aware of bad seismic properties for the table that includes fluid properties. An assumption can be made that all fluid in the interior and that is not locked in mineral phases is extracted onto the surface or some proto-ocean, therefore, the seismic properties excluding fluid are correct for the interior of a body under compacting under pressure.
