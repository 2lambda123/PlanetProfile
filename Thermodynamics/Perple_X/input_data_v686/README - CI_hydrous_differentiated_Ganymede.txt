This is a description file for the CI_hydrous_differentiated_Ganymede Perple_X run.

It was run with Perple_X 6.8.6.

The composition represents the bulk silicate portion of Ganymede, based on CI chondrite (From Lodders and Fegley, 1998), minus Fe + S to make a 80 wt.% Fe + 20 wt % S core. The amount of water is equivalent to the concentration in CI chondrites.

The thermodynamic database used was DEW13HP622ver_elements.dat.

Solution models included, and phases excluded, were based on the FRAC2D model for aqueous solution speciation implemented in Perple_X 6.8.6. Namely, melt(H) phases were allowed, among others.
