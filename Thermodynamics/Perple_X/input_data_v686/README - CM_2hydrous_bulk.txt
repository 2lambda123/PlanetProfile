This is a read me file to describe model CM_2hydrous_bulk_DEW13_meltH.dat.

This model represents a generic undifferentiated bodies of CM chondrite composition with only 2 wt% water (actually closer to 2.3 wt% because of nomarlization to 100 wt.%)(composition simplified from Lodders and Fegley, 1998, The Planetary Scientist's Companion book):
