This is a read me file to describe model "CV_hhph_DEW17_fluid_nomelt_685"

This model represents a generic undifferentiated body of CV chondrite composition, including volatile elements (composition simplified from Lodders and Fegley, 1998, The Planetary Scientist's Companion book):

Element	Weight%
H2	0.29
C	0.55
Mg	14.74
Al	1.73
Si	16.18
S2	2.27
Ca	1.9
Fe	24.22
O2	38.13
SUM	100.01

The thermodynamic database used was DEW17HP622ver_elements.dat.

Solution models included, and phases excluded, were based on the klb-1_hhph and morb_hhph benchmarks for Holland et al. (2013, J. Metamorph. Petrol.)'s thermodynamic set, implemented in Perple_X 6.8.5. Namely, no melt phases were allowed, among others.

Excluded phases:
stv, perL, limL, corL, hemL, qL, h2oL, foL, faL, woL, enL, diL, silL, anL, sil8L, fo8L, fa8L, q8L, cess, qjL, dijL, ctjL, fojL, fajL, hmjL, foTL, faTL.

Solutions included:
Gt(H), Fper(H), Mpv(H), Cpv(H), CFer(H), Aki(H), O(JH), Wad(H), Ring(H), Cpx(JH), Opx(JH), Hpx(H), NAl(H), Cor(H).

Note that fluids are allowed and that WERAMI tables show bulk (aggregate) properties of fluids and solids.
